Spike-One-Page-Website
======================

This PHP script allows you to create One Page Websites that are editable in Spike CMS.

It merges different pages in a Spike website into one page, and creates a navigation menu to scroll to the different anchors.

At the same time, it allows the website to be indexed by Google as seperate pages using the Ajax Crawling Specifications.

Two example Spike HTML template files are included to explain the main principles.
